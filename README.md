# RAGBot: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot

RAGBot is an intelligent chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that uses contextual information to answer user queries accurately and concisely. By integrating a custom retriever with a language model, RAGBot provides precise responses by searching relevant stored documents when available, or generating a concise answer otherwise.

## Features

- **Contextual Awareness**: Fetches relevant information from stored documents based on user queries.
- **Conversational AI**: Uses a language model to generate natural, conversational responses.
- **Concise & Direct Responses**: Provides brief answers and avoids unnecessary verbosity.
- **Embeddings for Retrieval**: Utilizes sentence embeddings for efficient and accurate retrieval.

## Tech Stack

- **Language Model**: [ChatGroq](https://groq.com) with the `llama3-8b-8192` model.
- **Embeddings**: Uses [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net) for document and query embedding.
- **Vector Store**: [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com) for efficient storage and retrieval of document embeddings.
- **Environment Management**: Managed with `.env` for API keys and configuration.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ragbot.git
   cd ragbot
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add your `GROQ_API_KEY` to the `.env` file:
     ```plaintext
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
     ```


## Usage

1. **Start the Chatbot**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the Bot**
   - You can start asking questions, and RAGBot will respond based on the retrieved information or with a general answer when no context is available.
   - Type "exit", "quit", or "stop" to end the session.

Example Interaction:
```plaintext
Ask: hi
Response: Hi! How can I help you today?

Ask: Tell me about cats.
Response: Cats are independent pets that often enjoy their own space.
```

## Code Overview

- **`app.py`**: The main script for running RAGBot. It sets up the retrieval chain and manages interactions with the user.
- **Custom Embeddings**: Implements a custom embedding class using SentenceTransformers for encoding documents and queries.
- **Retriever**: A `Chroma` vector store to retrieve the most relevant document for each query.
- **Prompt Template**: A template that instructs the language model to use context when available or respond with general knowledge concisely.


## Customization

- **Add Documents**: Add more documents to the `documents` list in `app.py` to expand the bot's knowledge base.
- **Adjust Response Style**: Modify the prompt in `app.py` to change how responses are generated. The prompt can be adjusted for tone, formality, or conciseness.
- **Search Parameters**: Update the `search_kwargs` in the retriever configuration to change the number of retrieved documents or search style.
